# Shuretling

This is the Shuretling flower website — a small starter site to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to open locally:

1. Open the folder in your browser by double-clicking `index.html`.
2. Or run a simple local server (recommended) from the folder in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\riqka\Documents\Phyton Works"
python -m http.server 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Files:
- index.html — main page with Home, Catalog, and Settings
- styles.css — styling (light and dark themes)
- script.js — navigation and theme toggle

If you want, I can:
- explain each file in simple English
- add translations or language-help notes to the page
- help deploy to GitHub Pages

How to run locally:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\riqka\Documents\Phyton Works"
python -m http.server 8000

# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Features:
- Home: welcome and intro
- Catalog: sample flower cards, search, buy button (demo)
- Settings: toggle Light/Dark theme (saved in browser)

Tell me which additional features you want (cart, prices, language translations, images). I can add them step-by-step.
